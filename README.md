# Playing Card Detection

## Introduction

I fine-tuned the YOLOv8 model on a [Roboflow dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/playing-cards-ow27d/dataset/4) to develop a model capable of detecting playing cards in real-time using a webcam. Additionaly, I developed a small program that allows the model to calculate scores based on a game called "LiÃªng", using the card detected.
